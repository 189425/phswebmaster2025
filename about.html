    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Established in 2024, we are one of the country's most renowned vegetarian restaurants with over 500 stores open across America.</p>
    <p>Our founder turned to vegetarianism in 2017 and decided to open the first <i>Green Goods</i> store in January 2024.  Back then, the menu only consisted of simple fruits and vegetables.  Now it has expanded with a wider variety of items, including pasta, eggs, and yogurt.</p>
