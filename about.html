		<h3>About Us</h3>
		<p class="normal">In the midst of a world with increasing environmental issues, it is important to recognize the influence of mother nature on our nutrition. The earth provides us with many valuable food items, from green vegetables to sweet fruits.</p>
		<p class="normal">In order to respect and preserve nature in gratitude for all that it has provided for us, we make sure to only use ingredients that were harvested purely from mother nature. We make sure to only use organic ingredients in our meals, and we have partnerships with local farms in order to bring fresh food to our guests. The farms send us organic produce which we then use in our kitchen to make delicious food. </p>
		<p class="normal">Our chefs all specialize in cooking vegetarian dishes, and they also use some traditional family recipes to give our food a homemade taste. After cooking, the waste from the produce and meals doesn’t go into the trash. Instead, we send the food leftovers and vegetable peelings back to the local farms that we get produce from. This is part of our partnership with the farms in order to create a more sustainable and eco-friendly process.</p>
		<p class="normal">We also want to promote the vegetarian diet in our restaurant in order to protect the animal life on this planet and advocate for more environmental preservation. Our mission is to create a safe place for people to enjoy pure vegetarian food that is harvested directly from nature, which is why we created “Green Haven.”</p>
